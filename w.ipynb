    "### Deep Neural Networks (DNN)\n",
    "1. **Definition**: A type of artificial neural network with multiple layers between the input and output layers.\n",
    "2. **Structure**: Composed of an input layer, hidden layers (multiple), and an output layer.\n",
    "3. **Function**: Learns to represent data through hierarchical feature learning.\n",
    "4. **Activation Functions**: Utilizes non-linear activation functions (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid) to introduce non-linearity.\n",
    "5. **Training**: Often trained using backpropagation and gradient descent.\n",
    "6. **Applications**: Used in various domains like speech recognition, image classification, and natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\n",
    "1. **Definition**: A specialized type of DNN designed primarily for processing structured grid data, such as images.\n",
    "2. **Structure**: Includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.\n",
    "3. **Convolutional Layers**: Use filters (kernels) to scan input data and extract features through convolution operations.\n",
    "4. **Pooling Layers**: Reduce dimensionality by down-sampling the feature maps, retaining essential information while reducing computation.\n",
    "5. **Feature Hierarchy**: Automatically learns spatial hierarchies of features, from edges in early layers to complex patterns in deeper layers.\n",
    "6. **Applications**: Widely used in image and video recognition, medical image analysis, and autonomous vehicles.\n",
